In this version :
* __Introducing **SpaceStats**__ : three new statistics has been added to the grades detail bottom sheet. I let you discover them by yourself (hold for indications).
* __So many fixes__, including the enhanced homework viewer (for EcoleDirecte users only) on the main page, LaTex compatibility, grades values on the grades evolution chart (hold to show) and so on...
* __There is still some bugs__ (some I know some I don't), but I release this update to avoid developing an application of which I don't know the flaws.
